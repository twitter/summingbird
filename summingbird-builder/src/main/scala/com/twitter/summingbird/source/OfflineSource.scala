/**
  * OfflineSource[Event] knows how to produce a scalding Pipe
  * representing all the Event objects associated with a given
  * BatchID. The scaldingSource method is responsible for returning a
  * TypedPipe[Event] that contains no events in the BatchID prior to
  * the lowerBound.
  *
  * At Twitter, a typical OfflineSource implementation will map this
  * lowerBound to a timestamp and use the ScaldingEnv to figure out how
  * much data beyond the lowerBound to process for a given run. Since
  * the HDFS log timestamps typically lag a few hours behind the
  * timestamps inside the scribed events, a Twitter
  * OfflineSource[Event,Time] will scoop up a few extra hours of data
  * on each side of the time range calculated off of the BatchIDs and
  * filter out events that donâ€™t belong inside the range. (If the data
  * in HDFS skews more than a couple of hours, this approach can miss
  * data, but this is a weakness of all current Hadoop data pipelines
  * at Twitter and not one that Summingbird aims to solve.)
