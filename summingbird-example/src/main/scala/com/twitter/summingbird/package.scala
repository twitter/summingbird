package com.twitter.summingbird

/**
  * The "example" package contains all of the code and configuration
  * necessary to run a basic Summingbird job locally that consumes
  * Tweets from the public streaming API and generates counts of the
  * number of times each word appears per tweet.
  *
  * Clients can use the code exposed in this example to build realtime
  * versions of word-count dashboards like Google's N-Gram product:
  *
  * http://books.google.com/ngrams
  *
  * # Code Structure
  *
  * ## Serialization.scala
  *
  * defines a number of serialization Injections
  * needed by the Storm and Scalding platforms to ensure that data can
  * move across network boundaries without corruption.
  *
  * ## Storage.scala
  *
  * Defines a few helper methods that make it easy to instantiate
  * instances of MergeableStore backed by Memcache.
  *
  * ## ExampleJob.scala
  *
  * The actual Summingbird job, plus a couple of helper implicits (a
  * batcher and a time extractor) necessary for running jobs in
  * combined batch/realtime mode across Scalding and Storm.
  *
  * ## StormRunner.scala
  *
  * Configuration and Execution of the summingbird word count job in
  * Storm's local mode, plus some advice on how to test that Storm is
  * populating the Memcache store with good counts.
  *
  *
  * # Have Fun!
  *
  * Please send any questions on the code you see here to
  * sritchie@twitter.com, or send me a tweet at @sritchie. Once you
  * get this code compiling and running, you'll be cooking with gas!
