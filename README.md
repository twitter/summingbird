## Summingbird [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/summingbird.png)](http://travis-ci.org/twitter/summingbird)

Summingbird is a library that lets you write MapReduce programs that look like native Scala or Java collection transformations and execute them on a number of well-known distributed MapReduce platforms, including [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm) and [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding).

While a word-counting aggregation in pure Scala might look like this:

```scala
  def wordCount(source: Iterable[String], store: MutableMap[String, Long]) =
    source.flatMap { sentence =>
      toWords(sentence).map(_ -> 1L)
    }.foreach { case (k, v) => store.update(k, store.get(k) + v) }
```

Counting words in Summingbird looks like this:

```scala
  def wordCount[P <: Platform[P]]
    (source: Producer[P, String], store: P#Store[String, Long]) =
      source.flatMap { sentence =>
        toWords(sentence).map(_ -> 1L)
      }.sumByKey(store)
```

The logic is exactly the same, and the code is almost the same. The main difference is that you can execute the Summingbird program in "batch mode" (using [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding)), in "realtime mode" (using [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm)), or on both Scalding and Storm in a hybrid batch/realtime mode that offers your application very attractive fault-tolerance properties.

Summingbird provides you with the primitives you need to build rock solid production systems.
