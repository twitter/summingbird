/**
  * CollectorMergeableStore merges (K, BatchID) -> V into the

  *
  * The summingbird storm topology is really just a Storehaus
  * MergeableStore that shards the various "merge" calls by key. This
  * brings us a little closer to expressing that idea, and lets us use
  * the "BufferingStore" combinator on the FlatMapBolt collector
  * itself without maintaining a separate SummingQueue in the
  * FlatMapBolt and recreating the logic.
