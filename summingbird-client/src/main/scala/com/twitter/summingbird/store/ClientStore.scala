  /**
   * The multiGet uses the "for" syntax internally to chain a bunch of computations
   * from T => Future[U].
   *
   * At a high level, the computation performed by the multiGet is the following:
   *
   *
   * - Look up the set of requested keys in the offlineStore. The
   *   offlineStore holds K -> (BatchID, V).
   *
   * - For each key, use the returned BatchID and the current BatchID
   *   (calculated by the batcher) to generate a sequence of BatchIDs
   *   that the onlineStore is holding. The onlineStore holds (K,
   *   BatchID) -> V, so a join between this BatchID sequence and the
   *   K provides a keyset to use for a multiGet to the onlineStore.
   *
   * - Perform this multiGet to the online store.
   *
   * - PIVOT the BatchIDs out of the online store's key into a
   *   sequence in the value -- then a monoid merge with the offline
   *   store will append the offline value onto the beginning of the
   *   sequence of (BatchID, V).
   *
   * - Finally, reduce this list by monoid-merging together all
   *   (BatchID, V) pairs. If any BatchID is missing from the sequence
   *   (if there are any holes, for example), that particular merged
   *   value's computation in the result will be a Future.exception vs
   *   a defined future.
   * - Drop the final BatchID off of all successfully aggregated
   *   values (since this BatchID will be the current batch in all
   *   successful cases).
   *
   * The onlineKeyFilter allows only a subset of the keys to be
   * fetched from the realtime layer.  This is a useful optimization
   * in, for example, time series data, where many of the keys that
   * are fetched are historical and therefore only need to be fetched
   * from batch.
   *
   * TODO (https://github.com/twitter/summingbird/issues/72): This
   * filter needs to be generalized correctly, and is probably
   * incorrect at the level of just supplying a boolean function. For
   * example, in most cases a function K => T would help tie in
   * batching logic more easily.
